Project Title: Enhancing Operational Insights for Delhivery through Data Analysis

About Delhivery:

Delhivery, a major player in India's commerce landscape, seeks to optimize its operations through data-driven decision-making. The data team at Delhivery is tasked with utilizing advanced analytics and feature engineering to extract valuable insights from their data engineering pipelines. This initiative is crucial to maintaining a competitive advantage in terms of quality, efficiency, and profitability.

Business Problem:

The primary business problem is to understand and process data emerging from Delhivery's data engineering pipelines. The specific objectives include cleaning, sanitizing, and manipulating the data to extract useful features. These features will, in turn, facilitate the data science team in building forecasting models for improved operational efficiency.

Tools Used:

The project leverages industry-standard tools for data analysis and visualization:

Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing. NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling. Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and exploration. Scipy: For statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and outlier detection.

Concepts Covered:

Feature Creation: Developing new features from raw data to enhance analysis.

Relationship Between Features: Understanding the connections and dependencies between different features. Column Normalization / Column Standardization: Ensuring uniformity and comparability across diverse columns. Handling Categorical Values: Encoding and transforming categorical data for analysis. Missing Values - Outlier Treatment / Types of Outliers: Addressing missing values and handling outliers for robust analysis.

Answering Questions:

The analysis addresses several key questions related to Delhivery's operational data:

Basic Data Cleaning and Exploration:

Handling missing values in the dataset. Analyzing the structure of the data. Merging rows using appropriate aggregations. Feature Engineering:

Extracting relevant features from destination and source names. Creating additional features from the trip_creation_time. In-Depth Analysis and Feature Engineering:

Calculating time differences and creating a new feature. Hypothesis testing and visual analysis to compare different time-related variables. Exploring relationships between various aggregated values. Outcomes:

Identification and handling of outliers using the IQR method. One-hot encoding of categorical variables like route_type. Normalization/standardization of numerical features for consistent scaling.

Outcomes:

The project outcomes aim to provide Delhivery with enhanced operational insights. These insights include improved understanding of delivery times, relationships between different variables, and the impact of specific features on operational efficiency.

This project not only showcases proficiency in using tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy but also demonstrates a strong grasp of key data science concepts and methodologies. The results are intended to guide Delhivery's operational strategies and contribute to overall business success.
